## Performance Analysis
1) Calculate and plot cumulative returns. Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500?

    a) From taking the cumlative returns from the 'whale portfolio', 'algo portfolio', and 'SPY porfolio', we were able to visualize which portfolio outperformed the S&P 500. The following portfolios outperfomed the S&P 500: Algo 1, Algo 2, Soros Fund MGMT LLC, Berkshire Hathaway INC. 

## Risk Analysis
1) Create a box plot for each of the returns. Which box has the largest spread? Which has the smallest spread?
    
    a) out of all the returns, Algo 1 has the largest spread. Meanwhile, the Soros Fund Manangemnt has the lowest spread.
  

2) Calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio. Which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500?
   
   a) The following portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500: Berkshire Hathaway, Tiger Global Managment LLC, and Algo 2.

## Rolling Statistics

1) Plot the rolling standard deviation of the firm's portfolios along with the rolling standard deviation of the S&P 500. Does the risk increase for each of the portfolios at the same time risk increases in the S&P?

     a) All the portfolios seem to have the same risk increases compared to the S&P 500. Tiger Global Management LLC looks to have more risk.

2) Construct a correlation table for the algorithmic, whale, and S&P 500 returns. Which returns most closely mimic the S&P?
    
    a) From looking at the table, the portfolio Berkshire Hathaway inc looks to be most correlated with the S&P

3) Choose one portfolio and plot a rolling beta between that portfolio's returns and S&P 500 returns. Does the portfolio seem sensitive to movements in the S&P 500?

    a) Although Soros fund managment llc performed above the S&P500 in returns, the beta between the soros fund and the underlying index of S&P 500 is well above 1. This means the soros fund has high sensitivity to the base index.
    
## Plot Sharpe Ratios

Investment managers and their institutional investors look at the return-to-risk ratio, not just the returns. (After all, if you have two portfolios that each offer a 10% return, yet one is lower risk, you would invest in the lower-risk portfolio, right?)


    1) Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.
    
    a) Both algo portfolios out performed the SPY return. As for the whale portfolios, all of them outperformed the S&P except for Paulson Co inc.
